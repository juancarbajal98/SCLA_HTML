<!-- hobby 1 -->
<p> My first favorite hobby is playing and watching soccer. Some of the best memories of my childhood were spent on a soccer field. I've grown up to watch it more often now and keeping up with my favorite teams is incredibly entertaining. </p>

<!-- hobby 2 -->
<p> My second favorite hobby is running. I was obsessed with long distance runs when I was a lot younger. I look forward to returning to marathon running after college. </p>

<!-- hobby 3 -->
<p> My third favorite hobby would have to be writing at least once a day for 30 minutes. I try to make this a habit to exercise creative writing or even just for fun. I find myself writing thoughts down sometimes, other times I'll do some sudoku, or even read and reflect. </p>
